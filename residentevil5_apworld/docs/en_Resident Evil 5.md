# Resident Evil 5(PC)

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

For now, every weapon, key, and chapter is randomized. In the future more will be randomized both among itself and via archipelago items.


## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any of the items which can be shuffled may also be placed into another player's world. It is possible to choose to limit certain items to your own world.

## Is this playable online?

From very brief testing, this should be playable online. However, both players must be connected to the same archipelago slot and using the same randomized files in order to play. If a player picks up an item that is different from what another player sees then it can cause desync, or entirely crash the mutliplayer session. If you run into any issues while palying multipalyer, please submit feedback on what happened when the crash occured to the Resident Evil 5 game channel.
